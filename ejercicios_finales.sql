-- Ejercicio 3
SELECT DISTINCT cosponsors.cosponsor_name as senator
FROM cosponsors
WHERE
	senator NOT IN (
	  	SELECT DISTINCT cosponsors.sponsor_name
	  	FROM cosponsors
	)

SELECT DISTINCT c1.cosponsor_name
FROM cosponsors c1
LEFT JOIN cosponsors c2
ON c1.cosponsor_name = c2.sponsor_name
-- This join identifies cosponsors
-- who have sponsored bills
WHERE c2.sponsor_name IS NULL
-- LEFT JOIN + NULL is a standard trick for excluding
-- rows. It's more efficient than WHERE ... NOT IN
